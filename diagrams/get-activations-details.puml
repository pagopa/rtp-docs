title RTP Activation API: GET /activations

actor "**Payer's Service Provider**" as PSP
participant "**Activation Service\n(API/Controller)**" as AS
participant "**Payer Service\n(Business Logic)**" as PS
database "**Database**" as DB

autonumber "<b>[0]"

PSP -> AS: **GET** /activations?page=0&size=20
activate AS

AS -> AS: **Security & Role Check**
note right of AS: Framework validates token & user role.\nCorresponds to `@PreAuthorize(...)`.

alt #palegreen **Success Case: Activations List Retrieved**

    AS -> AS: Get `serviceProvider` ID from Security Context
    note right of AS: As per `ReactiveSecurityContextHolder.getContext()`

    AS -> PS: `getActivationsByServiceProvider(serviceProvider, page, size)`
    activate PS
    note right of AS: The controller delegates to the service layer.

    PS -> DB: `getActivationsByServiceProvider(...)`
    activate DB
    note right of DB: Query is filtered by `serviceProvider` and paginated.
    DB --> PS: Returns `List<Payer>` and `total count`
    deactivate DB

    PS --> AS: `Tuple2<List<Payer>, Long>`
    deactivate PS
    note right of PS: The service successfully returns the DB result.

    AS -> AS: Map results to `PageOfActivationsDto`
    note right of AS: Corresponds to `activationDtoMapper.toPageDto(...)`

    AS --> PSP: **200 OK**\n(Returns `PageOfActivationsDto`)
    note left of PSP
        A paginated list of accessible
        activations is returned.

else #darkred **Error Cases**

    group Authentication / Authorization Error
        AS --> PSP: **401 Unauthorized** / **403 Forbidden**
        note right of AS: Occurs if the initial `@PreAuthorize` check fails.
    end group

    group Client-Side Errors
        AS --> PSP: **400 Bad Request**\n(e.g., Invalid 'page' or 'size' parameters)
        AS --> PSP: **429 Too Many Requests**\n(e.g., Rate limit exceeded)
    end group

    group Server-Side Error
        AS -> AS: An unexpected internal error occurs
