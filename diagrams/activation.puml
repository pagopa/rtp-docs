title RTP Activation API: POST /activations

actor "**Payer's Service Provider**" as PSP
participant "**Activation Service**" as AS
database "**Database**" as DB

autonumber "<b>[0]"

PSP -> AS: **POST** /activations\n(Activate RTP for a Payer)
activate AS

note right of AS
  **Operation:** `activatePayer`
  A Payer's SP calls this to register a user for the RTP service.
end note

AS -> AS: Validate Request & Security Token

alt #palegreen **Success Case: Activation Created**

    AS -> AS: Create `Payer` object with a new `ActivationID` and current timestamp
    note right: As per `new Payer(activationID, serviceProviderDebtor, ...)`

    AS -> DB: `save(payer)`
    activate DB
    DB --> AS: Payer saved successfully
    deactivate DB

    AS -> AS: Log successful activation
    note right: As per `.doOnSuccess(...)`

    AS --> PSP: **201 Created**\nHeader: `Location: /activations/{newActivationId}`
    note left of PSP
        The activation was successful.
        The Payer can now receive RTPs.
    end note

else #lightyellow **Conflict: Payer Already Exists**

    AS -> AS: Create `Payer` object with a new `ActivationID` and current timestamp

    AS -> DB: `save(payer)`
    activate DB
    DB --> AS: **Error:** `DuplicateKeyException`
    deactivate DB
    note right of AS: A unique key constraint (e.g., on fiscalCode) was violated in the database.

    AS -> AS: Map `DuplicateKeyException` to `PayerAlreadyExists` error
    note right: As per `.onErrorMap(...)`

    AS --> PSP: **409 Conflict**\nHeader: `Location: /activations/{existingActivationId}`
    note left of PSP
        An activation for this Payer already exists.
        The `Location` header points to the existing resource.
    end note

    group Client-Side Errors
        AS --> PSP: **400 Bad Request**\n(e.g., Invalid fiscal code, missing fields)
        AS --> PSP: **401 Unauthorized**\n(e.g., Invalid or expired security token)
        AS --> PSP: **403 Forbidden**\n(e.g., Insufficient permissions)
        AS --> PSP: **429 Too Many Requests**\n(e.g., Rate limit exceeded)
    end group

    group Server-Side Error
        AS -> AS: An unexpected internal error occurs
        note right: e.g., Database connection failure, unhandled exception.
        AS --> PSP: **500 Internal Server Error**
